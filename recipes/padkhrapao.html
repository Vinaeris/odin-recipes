        <h1>Pad Khra Pao</h1>
        <img src="./images/padkhrapao.jpg" alt="A dish of delicious pad khra pao or thai basil chicken">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Also known as Thai basil chicken, this recipe packs quite some heat. Divinely delicious with some hot, steamed rice, the Thai basil provides a stronger flavour and a subtly different texture than conventional basil. However they are easily interchangeable.</p>
        <p>For those less-initiated with spicy food, consider omitting the birds' eye chilli or substituting them with the less spicy variants!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>400g minced chicken or diced chicken breast</li>
                <li>3 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>4 tbsp sweet soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>5-10 birds' eye chillies, sliced</li>
                <li>a handful of thai basil, or about 20-25 leaves</li>
                <li>salt, sugar, and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>cooking oil</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>    
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Start cooking white rice first so it's ready to serve with the dish.</li>
                <li>Heat some oil in the wok. When sufficiently hot (bubbling), lower heat to low and add minced garlic and birds' eye chillies. Stir for about 1 minute or until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add chicken and increase heat. Mix them thoroughly and stir until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add in the sauces: oyster sauce, soy sauce, and fish sauce. Mix well and let simmer for a minute.</li>
                <li>Toss in the thai basil and mix until the leaves are wilted. Season to taste and place off-heat.</li>
                <li>In a separate pan, fry a couple of eggs sunny side-up.</li>
                <li>Place fried egg over a bed of rice and the chicken mixture to the side. Serve hot!</li>
            </ol>
